    "# How to compile a new subset of HealthData.csv\n",
    "## By Thomas White\n",
    "### English 105\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose:\n",
    "* This list of instructions is intended to help other users of GitHub learn how to use portions of a larger dataset in order to draw a more specific conclusion about a smaller portion  of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experience needed?\n",
    "* You'll need to know some basic aspects of Python3, mainly how to use the pandas package for data analysis, which can be accessed here:\n",
    "[Using the Pandas Package for Data Analysis, part one](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/4810/files/1959947?wrap=1)\n",
    "[Using the Pandas Package for Data Analysis, part two](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/4810/files/1959948?wrap=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System Requirements:\n",
    "* You'll need to download Anaconda to your computer. This comes with JupyterLab, which we'll be using. We'll also be using several files and links, which will be given to you throughout this guide. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are we doing?\n",
    "* In my example, I have chosen to look at *median household income by region.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data file we're using, HealthData.csv, is massive, and we obviously don't need all of it to look at two columns of data, so we can reduce the data sheet via indexing. Here is how:*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "1. Open Anaconda Navigator, followed by JupyterLab.\n",
    "2. Click on the file icon with a plus sign on it. Name the file whatever you wish.\n",
    "3. Within your new file, click on the blue plus sign icon. \n",
    "4. Then, click on the big Python3 button under 'Notebook'. This should take you to a blank page with a list of number(s) on the side.\n",
    "5. Open the \"HealthData.csv\" file. This is listed below:\n",
    "[Health Data](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/4810/files/1951167?wrap=1)\n",
    "6. Download this data file to your computer. It should be downloaded as a \".csv\" file.\n",
    "7. Once back on your blank Python3 page, click the arrow that is pointing up with a horizontal line below it in the top left corner. Click on \"HealthData.csv\".\n",
    "8. Go back to your blank Python3 file and click on the empty horizontal box in the middle of the screen.\n",
    "##### Here is where the actual coding starts!\n",
    "9. Import the packages that we'll need to use with Python. This is done by writing, `import numpy as np` and `import pandas as pd` in the first box.\n",
    "* Keep these commands in the same box, but put them on separate lines.* \n",
    "* After writing your code in each box, hold shift and press enter to run each box.* "
