# 105-Unit-3

This is a repository with the intent of helping other GitHub users learn how to use portions of a larger dataset in order to draw a more specific conclusion about a smaller portion of the data. By using a larger dataset, and then looking at something more specific (like Median household income by Region), GitHub users must filter a large dataset into a smaller one. 

This repository contains 4 main areas of interest:
1. modules created by others that cover basic topics in coding with Python3
2. module created by myself that covers how to transform a larger dataset into a smaller, more focused one
3. a larger dataset (HealthData.csv) for users to explore further
4. subsets of a larger dataset which are analyzed further

Also, users who are simply interested in how Median household income differs by region can witness this differences.
