# 105-Unit-3

This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Prof. Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL 105 at UNC Chapel Hill.

The repository contains 3 python notebooks:
1. module on covering basic topics in coding with Python3
2. module on getting started with the Pandas package
3. module on using the Pandas package for data analysis

These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the [Research Hub](#ADD LINK) of UNC's Davis library. 

When writing your own README, remember the following guidelines:

- PROVENANCE (where did this code/data come from?)
- PURPOSE (what/who is is for)
- POTENTIAL (why was this repo created and what might people do with it)
