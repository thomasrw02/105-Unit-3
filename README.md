# 105-Unit-3

This is a repository with the intent of helping other GitHub users learn how to use portions of a larger dataset (in this case, HealthData.csv) in order to draw more specific conclusions about a smaller portion of the data. By using a larger dataset, and then looking at something more specific (like Median household income by Region), GitHub users must filter a large dataset into a smaller one. 

This repository contains 4 main areas of interest:
1. Modules created by others that cover basic topics in coding with Python3
2. A module created by myself that covers how to transform a larger dataset into a smaller, more focused one
3. A larger dataset (HealthData.csv) for users to explore further - ![HealthData.csv](https://uncch.instructure.com/courses/4810/files/1951167?wrap=1)
4. Subsets of a larger dataset which are analyzed further

Also, users who are simply interested in how Median household income differs by region can witness these differences. Speaking of, here is an illustration of how income differs across the US:

This repository was created as a project for Professor Steven Gotzler's English 105 class at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
