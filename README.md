# 105-Unit-3

This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Prof. Gotzler's Fall 2022 sections of ENGL 105 at UNC Chapel Hill.

The repository contains 3 python notebooks covering basic topics in coding with Python3, and beginner modules on using the Pandas package for data analysis. 

These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the research hib of UNC's Davis library. 

When writing your own README, remember the following guidelines:

- PROVENANCE (where did this code/data come from?)
- PURPOSE (what/who is is for)
- POTENTIAL (why was this repo created and what might people do with it)
